# xboxController-Reader
This program reads the inputs of an xbox controller and converts them into an ascii string.
It then outputs the ascii strings to a com port. If you need something that can convert xbox inputs into serial then this is very light and
does exactly that. This is good for any kind of simple control of an MCU using a gamepad. This will also work with a PS4 controller if you
use DS4 windows.
